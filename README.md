# **2_node_msql_rest_Api**
Second rest api with node.js  y Express on mysql db, I take as reference a Fazt project about api rest: http://www.faztweb.com, I made  changes in the code but the most important change is that I used a docker container runing mysql, this is to test and run the api rest, I don't install mysql in my computer, I use a docker-compose.yml file
